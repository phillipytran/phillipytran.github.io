## Mentoring Undergraduate Students
I have mentored an undergraduate student (Shovan Bhatia) for 2 years (2019 - ongoing) and helped him progress in the field of medical robotics. He is a talented researcher and student and while working with me on the FLEXotendon Glove exoskeleton system, he has received two awards to help him continue his research development. The first award he obtained is the [Georgia Tech President's Undergraduate Research Award (PURA)](http://www.undergradresearch.gatech.edu/content/presidents-undergraduate-research-awards), a competitive internal award at Georgia Tech that is offered to undergraduate students who demonstrate a commitment to research. The second award is the [Barry Goldwater Scholarship](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/news/bme-undergrad-shovan-bhatia-wins-2021-barry-goldwater-scholarship), a highly selective scholarship that was awarded to 408 undergraduate students in the US.

## Teaching Opportunities
#### <i>Teaching Practicum</i>
In the Fall 2020 semester, I conducted my teaching practicum for BMED4739/6739 (Medical Robotics), an introductory robotics class offered to both undergraduate and graduate students. During the course of the semester, I planned and held three lectures covering various topics (medical robotics research, forward kinematics, and dynamics). I also held review sessions before each exam to help students review the class material.
  
#### <i>Teaching Assistantships</i>
In the Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 semesters, I held a teaching assistant position in ECE4781 (Biomedical Instrumentation) and ECE4782 (Biosystems Analysis), respectively. During these semesters, I graded homework assignments and exams, and I also held review sessions before each exam.
