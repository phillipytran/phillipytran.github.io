## Mentoring Undergraduate Students
I have mentored an undergraduate student (Shovan Bhatia) for 2 years (2019 - ongoing) and helped him progress in the field of medical robotics. He is a talented researcher and student and while working with me on the FLEXotendon Glove exoskeleton system, he has received two awards to help him continue his research development. The first award he obtained is the [Georgia Tech President's Undergraduate Research Award (PURA)](http://www.undergradresearch.gatech.edu/content/presidents-undergraduate-research-awards), a competitive internal award at Georgia Tech that is offered to undergraduate students who demonstrate a commitment to research. The second award is the [Barry Goldwater Scholarship](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/news/bme-undergrad-shovan-bhatia-wins-2021-barry-goldwater-scholarship), a highly selective scholarship that was awarded to 408 undergraduate students in the US.
