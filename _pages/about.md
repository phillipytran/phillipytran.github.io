I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School/Boston Children's Hospital. I conduct research with Professor Pierre E. Dupont in the [Dupont Laboratory](https://robotics.tch.harvard.edu/) and am currently working on a robotic platform for automating the operation of tendon-controlled steerable surgical catheters, focusing on applications for cardiac operations and procedures.

I received my PhD in Bioengineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2023. I was a part of the [Medical Robotics and Automation (RoboMed) Laboratory](https://robomed.gatech.edu/) under Professor Jaydev P. Desai. My research was in the field of rehabilitative/assitive robotics, and I worked on a soft robotic hand exoskeleton intended to assist individuals with spinal cord injury. I have collaborated with researchers at the [Emory University Department of Rehabilitation Medicine](http://www.rehabmed.emory.edu/), the [Georgia Institute of Technology Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/), and clinicians at the [Shriners Hospitals for Children, Philadelphia](https://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/philadelphia). I am interested in the modeling, control, and design of robots, especially for soft robots, as well as additive manufacturing and fabrication.
