I am a PhD candidate in Bioengineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am a part of the [Medical Robotics and Automation (RoboMed) Laboratory](https://robomed.gatech.edu/) under Dr. Jaydev P. Desai. My research is in the field of rehabilitative/assitive robotics, and I am currently working on a soft robotic hand exoskeleton intended to assist individuals with spinal cord injury. I have collaborated with researchers at the [Emory University Department of Rehabilitation Medicine](http://www.rehabmed.emory.edu/), the [Georgia Institute of Technology Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/), and clinicians at the [Shriners Hospitals for Children, Philadelphia](https://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/philadelphia). I am interested in the modeling, control, and design of robots, especially for soft robots, as well as additive manufacturing and fabrication.

Please contact me at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ptran49[at]gatech[dot]edu</code> for any questions about my research and/or my interests.
