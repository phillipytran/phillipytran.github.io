I am a Robotics Research Engineer at Aurora Flight Sciences. I work in the Robotics Group and am currently part of the team working on the [Learning Introspective Control (LINC)](https://www.darpa.mil/program/learning-introspective-control) project. We are working with unmanned surface vehicles to achieve the objective of a real-time adaptive controller in manned and unmanned systems.

I received my PhD in Bioengineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2023. I was a part of the [Medical Robotics and Automation (RoboMed) Laboratory](https://robomed.gatech.edu/) under Dr. Jaydev P. Desai. My research was in the field of rehabilitative/assitive robotics, and I worked on a soft robotic hand exoskeleton intended to assist individuals with spinal cord injury. I have collaborated with researchers at the [Emory University Department of Rehabilitation Medicine](http://www.rehabmed.emory.edu/), the [Georgia Institute of Technology Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/), and clinicians at the [Shriners Hospitals for Children, Philadelphia](https://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/philadelphia). I am interested in the modeling, control, and design of robots, especially for soft robots, as well as additive manufacturing and fabrication.
